**Welcome to the N3C Phenotype & Data Acquisition Workstream**

**Our work.** In collaboration with other N3C workstreams, we are working to establish a common COVID-19 phenotype that will define the data pull for the limited data set.  We are working to write cohort identification and data extraction scripts against four common data models (OMOP, PCORnet, ACT, and TriNetX) in order to aid sites in submitting data to the N3C central repository.

You’ll find the most recent phenotype [here](https://github.com/National-COVID-Cohort-Collaborative/Phenotype_Data_Acquisition/wiki/Latest-Phenotype).

**If you’re a new N3C site:** Please start by reviewing the [documentation ](https://github.com/National-COVID-Cohort-Collaborative/Phenotype_Data_Acquisition/wiki)we’ve written for running our scripts, customized for each data model. 

**Want to work with us? How to get involved.** We encourage participation from the community! If you have a bug or an idea, browse the open issues before opening a new one. Please use the GitHub issue tracker to submit any comments or suggestions.

**Where to find known issues**

We are using[ Github issues](https://github.com/National-COVID-Cohort-Collaborative/Phenotype_Data_Acquisition/issues) for our public bugs. We will keep a close eye on this and try to make it clear when we have a fix. Before you file a new issue please check to make sure your problem doesn’t already exist.

**Reporting new issues**

The best way for your bug to get fixed is to open a GitHub Issue and provide enough information for us to try and replicate what you’re seeing. Useful information includes the database management system you’re using, the data model you’re running, the database client you’re using, your operating system, etc. 

**Taking it to Slack**

It’s important to us that we are able to do our best work and be good members in the community. If we need to understand more about your issue, we will share a quick message with you on the CD2H Slack.  That way we will never clog your inbox over this!

**Documentation**

We will use the [Wiki ](https://github.com/National-COVID-Cohort-Collaborative/Phenotype_Data_Acquisition/wiki)on this repo to share all documentation. Please take a look!

**Code of Conduct**

It’s important to us to keep our community awesome, growing and collaborative and ask for your help in keeping it that way.  Please refer to our [Code of Conduct](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UOAHAoa0S7U2HFoepACaENKE2Vomr7y2LgPF29AW8zw/edit) for some guidelines.
