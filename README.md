**Welcome to the Git repo for the N3C Tenant Pilot!**

**Our Work** 

In collaboration with other N3C workstreams, we are working to establish a common "longitudinal phenotype" that will define the data pull for the limited data set.  Our current plans are to support the OMOP and PCORnet data models.

**Documentation** 

Under construction! Once we have a final phenotype and submission instructions ready to go, we will update the Wiki on this repo with everything you need to know.

**Want to work with us? How to get involved.** 

We encourage participation from the community! If you have a bug or an idea, browse the open issues before opening a new one. Please use the GitHub issue tracker to submit any comments or suggestions.

**Where to find known issues**

We are using[ Github issues](https://github.com/National-COVID-Cohort-Collaborative/tenant-pilot/issues) for our public bugs. We will keep a close eye on this and try to make it clear when we have a fix. Before you file a new issue please check to make sure your problem doesn’t already exist.

**Reporting new issues**

The best way for your bug to get fixed is to open a GitHub Issue and provide enough information for us to try and replicate what you’re seeing. Useful information includes the database management system you’re using, the data model you’re running, the database client you’re using, your operating system, etc.
